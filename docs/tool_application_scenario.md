## Introduction to Scenarios

This document introduces the use of `Faucet`, `Quick Wallet`, and `Keypair Generator` in a simple scenario. In this scenario, we take the test network as an example. The scenario is: generating two account addresses A and B, sending 200 test BUs to account A, and account A transferring 50 test BUs to account B.

## Implementation of the Scenario Example

We will introduce the implementation process of the scenario example.

### Generating Account Addresses

The account address and private key can be generated by KeypairGenerator. To generate an account address, you have to complete the following steps.
1. Log in `Keypair Generator`.
2. Click **Generator** to generate the address and private key of account A shown as the figure below:

Address: *buQttWTBP6tVRo9jALUT3UqFzopuXKiogbed*

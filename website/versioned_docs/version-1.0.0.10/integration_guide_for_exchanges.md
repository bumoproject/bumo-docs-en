## Overview

This document is for exchanges to install the BUMO node, and use the
BUMO SDK.


## JAVA SDK Usage

The use of the JAVA SDK includes [Generating Address for Users to Recharge](#generating-address-for-users-to-recharge),  [Checking the Legality
of Account Address](#checking-the-legality-of-account-address), and [Asset Transaction](#asset-transaction).

### Generating Address for Users to Recharge

The exchange needs to generate an address for each user to recharge. The
exchange can create the user’s address to recharge through
`Keypair.generator()` provided in Bumo-sdk-java. The specific example
is as follows:

```java
   /**

        * Generate an account private key, public key and address
        */
       @Test
       public void createAccount() {
           Keypair keypair = Keypair.generator();
           System.out.println(JSON.toJSONString(keypair, true));
       }
```
The return value is shown below:

```json
{
    "address": "buQa6wYkP9YPtE7xGJZKZ4TLHEJ79XFTFXRC",
    "privateKey": "privbytvfniP81UAD9FzyVhe43U2EKXcZqDXfkv2txhHuKN9AJszg4VC",
    "publicKey": "b00152f649c63d1b069a19f3a4647333cc9734f8f19452932ce25a4d6bd6b3697e1d88e69d61"
}
```

### Checking the Legality of Account Address

Check the validity of the account address by the code shown below.

```java
   /**

        * Check whether the account address is valid
        */
       @Test
       public void checkAccountAddress() {
           String address = "buQemmMwmRQY1JkcU7w3nhruoX5N3j6C29uo";
           AccountCheckValidRequest accountCheckValidRequest = new AccountCheckValidRequest();
           accountCheckValidRequest.setAddress(address);
           AccountCheckValidResponse accountCheckValidResponse = sdk.getAccountService().checkValid(accountCheckValidRequest);
           if (0 == accountCheckValidResponse.getErrorCode()) {
               System.out.println(accountCheckValidResponse.getResult().isValid());
           } else {
               System.out.println(JSON.toJSONString(accountCheckValidResponse, true));
           }
       }
```

**Note**:
- If the return value is `true`, the account address is legal.
- If the return value is `false`, the account address is illegal.

### Asset Transaction

In the BUMO network, a block is generated every 10 seconds, and each
transaction only needs one confirmation to get its final state. In this
section, we will introduce [Detecting User Recharging](#detecting-user-recharging), [Withdrawing or Transferring
BU by Users](#withdrawing-or-transferring-bu-by-users) and [Querying Transactions](#querying-transactions).

#### Detecting User Recharging

The exchange needs to monitor block generation, and then parse the
transaction records in the block to confirm the user’s recharge
behavior. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Make sure that the node block status is normal.
2. Analyze the transactions contained in the block (for parsing methods, see parsing transactions in the block).
3. Record the results after parsing.

**Viewing the Block Status**

View the block status by the code shown below.

```java
   /**

        * Check whether the connected node is synchronous in the blockchain
        */
       @Test
       public void checkBlockStatus() {
           BlockCheckStatusResponse response = sdk.getBlockService().checkStatus();
           System.out.println(response.getResult().getSynchronous());
       }
```
**Note**:
- If the return value is `true`, the block is normal.
- If the return value is `false`, the block is abnormal.

**Parsing Transactions in the Block**

The exchange can query the transactions in the block according to the
block height, and then analyze each transaction.

Example of request:

```java
   /**

        * Detect user recharge operations
        * <p>
        *Detect user recharge actions by parsing transactions in the block
        */
       @Test
       public void getTransactionOfBolck() {
           Long blockNumber = 617247L;// Block 617247
           BlockGetTransactionsRequest request = new BlockGetTransactionsRequest();
           request.setBlockNumber(blockNumber);
           BlockGetTransactionsResponse response = sdk.getBlockService().getTransactions(request);
           if (0 == response.getErrorCode()) {
               System.out.println(JSON.toJSONString(response, true));
           } else {
               System.out.println("Failure\n" + JSON.toJSONString(response, true));
           }
           //Detect whether an account has recharged BU
           // Analyze transactions[n].transaction.operations[n].pay_coin.dest_address 
    
           // Note:
           // Operations are arrays, there may be multiple transfer operations
       }
```
The response message is shown below:

```json

#### Withdrawing or Transferring BU by Users

For BU withdrawal operations, refer to the transfer example provided by
bumo-sdk-java as follows:

```java
   /**
        * Send a transaction of sending bu
        *
        * @throws Exception
        */
       @Test
       public void sendBu() throws Exception {
           // Init variable
           // The account private key to send bu
           String senderPrivateKey = "privbyQCRp7DLqKtRFCqKQJr81TurTqG6UKXMMtGAmPG3abcM9XHjWvq";
           // The account address to receive bu
           String destAddress = "buQswSaKDACkrFsnP1wcVsLAUzXQsemauE";
           // The amount to be sent
           Long amount = ToBaseUnit.BU2MO("0.01");
           // The fixed write 1000L, the unit is MO
           Long gasPrice = 1000L;
           // Set up the maximum cost 0.01BU
           Long feeLimit = ToBaseUnit.BU2MO("0.01");
           // Transaction initiation account's nonce + 1
           Long nonce = 1L;

           // Record txhash for subsequent confirmation of the real result of the transaction.
           // After recommending five blocks, call again through txhash `Get the transaction information
           // from the transaction Hash'(see example: getTxByHash ()) to confirm the final result of the transaction
           String txhash = sendBu(senderPrivateKey, destAddress, amount, nonce, gasPrice, feeLimit);
    
       }
```
**Note**:
- Record the hash value of the BU withdrawal operation to view the final result of the BU withdrawal operation
- The current (2018-04-23) lowest value of `gasPrice` is 1000MO
- It is recommended to fill in 1000000 MO for `feeLimit`, which equals to 0.01BU

#### Querying Transactions

The final result of the BU withdrawal operation can be queried by the
hash value returned when the BU withdrawal operation is initiated.

The call example is as follows:

```java
   /**
    * Get transaction information based on the transaction Hash
    */
       @Test
       public void getTxByHash() {
           String txHash = "fba9c3f73705ca3eb865c7ec2959c30bd27534509796fd5b208b0576ab155d95";
           TransactionGetInfoRequest request = new TransactionGetInfoRequest();
           request.setHash(txHash);
           TransactionGetInfoResponse response = sdk.getTransactionService().getInfo(request);
           if (0 == response.getErrorCode()) {
               System.out.println(JSON.toJSONString(response, true));
           } else {
               System.out.println("Failure\n" + JSON.toJSONString(response, true));
           }
       }
```

**Note**:
- When the number of tx.totalCount is greater than or equal to 1, the transaction history exists.
- When tx.transactions.errorCode equals 0, it indicates that the transaction is successful, otherwise the transaction is not successful. 
- For the withdrawal operation, the exchange should pay attention to the pay_coin operation.

## FAQ


**Start node in BUChain command line**

Q: Do I need to start the node when using the BUChain command line?

A: No.

**Are the values of gas_price and fee_limit fixed**

Q: Are Gas_price fixed at 1000MO and fee_limit fixed at 1000000MO?

A: They are not fixed. But at present (2018-04-23) gas_price is 1000MO,
the larger the gas_price is, the higher the priority for transactions to
be packaged. The fee_limit is the maximum transaction fees for the
blockchain when the transaction is initiated. If the transaction is
legal, the actual fees charged are less than the fee_limit filled by the
caller. (gas_price can be obtained from the result.fees.gas_price field
in the query result via the following link:

http://seed1.bumo.io:16002/getLedger?with_fee=true

**Transfer account balance**

Q: Can I transfer all the balance from my account?

A: No. In order to prevent DDOS attacks, and prevent creating a large
number of spam accounts, the activated accounts of BUMO must reserve a
certain amount of BU, currently at 0.1 BU (it can be obtained from the
result.fees.base_reserve field in the query result via the following
link:

http://seed1.bumo.io:16002/getLedger?with_fee=true

## Overview

### Background

As the next-generation commercial public chain - BUMO has always been committed to breaking through the blockchain technology bottleneck and promoting mass adoption for business. When released in 2018, BUMO pioneered a three-tier architecture to help blockchain technology applied to a variety of commercial applications. BUMO not only provides open, efficient, and scalable network protocols in a decentralized manner, but also provides a second-tier agreement on asset digitization and value circulation in various industries such as finance, internet of things, and sharing economy. BUMO builds a value Internet under the “Digital Everything Framework” (DeF) for business applications. BUMO is committed to building a distributed public chain ecosystem for commercial use with widely digital trust, free value movement, public engagement and application sharing. This public chain will be an open community platform which is built and shared by the community.


### Purpose

After running on the main network for one year, it is proved the technology of BUMO is stable and the ecosystem is developing in an orderly manner. The BUMO Foundation plans to upgrade the BUMO public chain governance by launching the community governance program where community participants can campaign for super nodes and form the highest governance body of the BUMO public chain – the Node Governance Committee. The Community Governance Program is an open ecological program embracing the entire industry participation, and truly delegates the governance right of BUMO public chain to the community.

After the upgrade is completed, together with the mainchain-childchain (Orbits) and mainchain-mainchain (Canel) framework upgrade for the network layer of BUMO, and the second layer of BUMO Digital Everything Framework (DeF) for commercial applications and related ATP 60 agreement release, the ecosystem of BUMO will form a closed loop. BUMO will be the container of token economy for the decentralized community, helping commercial applications to complete business model innovations with a brand new value Internet by the ecological support of technology, services and economic models.

This Community Governance Program includes two types of nodes, which are validating nodes and ecological nodes. The validating nodes belong to the physical nodes, participate in the BU Firework consensus and block packaging, and are the infrastructure in the BUMO ecosystem. The ecological nodes are virtual nodes that help BUMO build an ecosystem with their social or public influence. The Community Governance Program is going to select 19 validating nodes and 21 ecological nodes. The vote will be launched in the community, and the whole voting process is fair and transparent. Everyone in the community can participate this vote and benefit from it.

The BUMO public chain ecosystem is completely open and autonomous, seamlessly connecting the physical world to the blockchain digital world. Once selected as a super node, you can be authorized by the BUMO community to engage in BUMO's business and community development activities. Under the governance rules of the tokenized economy, there are incentives to engage in various activities. For example, you can submit a Development Plan Proposal, and receive support from the BUMO Ecosystem, the Community Fund, the Node Governance Committee and other resources from the community after your proposal is approved. Community Governance Program regularly campaigns for the highest governance body of the BUMO public chain – the Node Governance Committee.

BUMO has always believed that blockchain technology will profoundly change the social collaboration. The BUMO public chain itself also breaks the boundaries of traditional business organization governance, explores a new approach to community governance, and truly delegates governance right to the community. The Community Governance Program is the embodiment and sublimation of the BUMO ecological consensus, and is the first step in building a large-scale BUMO business ecosystem.

### Current Plan

BUMO launches the Community Governance Campaign in the hope of breaking the performance bottleneck of blockchain with practical actions and promoting commercial projects. The current plan is divided into four stages.

Time     | Outline | Task
----------|---------|---------
2019.5.26 |Registration| Open the application channel for campaign nodes, officially launch the Community Governance Program, and invite global partners to participate
2019.7.1 | Release nodes| The first batch of campaign nodes is officially announced
2019.7.10 | Start voting | The campaign officially begins, and the voting channel is opened simultaneously
2019.7.28 | Form the node committee | Convene the first "Node Governance Committee" meeting


## Rules for Participation in Community Governance

### Description of Roles 

There are four roles in the BUMO Community Governance Program: Super nodes (validating nodes and ecological nodes), users, foundation, and committee. The specific description is in the following table:

Role     | Description 
-------- |------
Super nodes | Super nodes consist of validating nodes and <br />ecological nodes 
Campaign nodes | Campaign nodes consist of the validating <br />campaign node set and the ecological campaign <br />node set 
Validating nodes | Validating nodes are physical nodes for BUfirework <br />consensus and block packaging, the number is 19 
Ecological nodes| Ecological nodes are virtual nodes for building the <br />BUMO ecosystem with their social or public influence, <br />the number is 21 
Users | Holders of the token, who have accounts on the <br />BUMO chain and are eligible to campaign, vote, <br />and sponsor node co-funding projects 
Foundation| The BUMO Foundation, the initiator of this event, <br />will transfer the highest authority of the BUMO <br />public chain to the Node Committee after this event, <br />and has the final right to interpret the rules related <br />to this program during the implementation of this program 
Committee | The node committee is formed by the super nodes. <br />After the campaign is completed, the top 3 validating <br />nodes and the top 2 ecological nodes form the node <br />committee. Later, the BUMO Node Committee replaces <br />the BUMO Foundation as the highest governing authority <br />for the BUMO public chain ecosystem 


### Glossary

**Super Node**：Both validating nodes and ecological nodes are referred to as super nodes.

**Margin**：To apply for a super node, a certain amount of BUs as the campaign margin will be frozen. The margin is frozen during the campaign, which means the margin cannot be traded and used until the campaign node voluntarily gives up the campaign qualification.

**Account Address of Token**：The account address used by the applicant to pay the margin when applying to become a super node. This address is also used for subsequent Token-related operations (additional margin, rewards, withdrawal of margin, etc). The account address of token is created on the BUMO main network and belongs to the node applicant.

**Address of Validating Node**：The address configured on the server for the validating node (the server is established and owned by the node applicant, and used to support node consensus). The addresses involved in blockchain consensus, transaction verification, and block generation belong to validating nodes.

**Equity Value**：Equity value of the campaign node = Margin * 2 + Votes (received by the current node). The equity value affects the ranking of the campaign node. The higher the equity value, the higher the ranking, and the more likely the campaign is successful.

**Validating Right**：The top 19 validating nodes in the campaign of validating node set are in charge of block generation and enjoy the validating right.

**Node Co-funding**: The applicant for an ecological node can initiate “node co-funding” to get support from other users and communities, jointly building an ecological node. The validating node does not support co-funding mode.

**Margin of Co-funding**: The initiator of the node co-funding project needs to transfer in a certain amount of BUs as the co-funding margin. The co-funding margin is frozen during the node co-funding and campaign. In this state, the co-funding margin cannot be traded and used until the campaign node gives up qualification for campaign or voluntarily withdraws from the node co-funding project.

**Address of Margin**：When nodes apply for super nodes, each node needs to transfer the required margin to this address. The BUs in this address are frozen, and the address is made public.


### How to Participate in the Election of Super Nodes

The BUMO super nodes enjoy the most benefits in the public BUMO chain ecosystem and they are also responsible for the expansion of the community and vitality of the ecology and the promotion of business related to BU.

The Community Governance Program is mainly for organizations and individuals with mature business modes. Participating in the node campaign requires strength and influence to gain the recognition and trust of all ecological participants. By setting up a barrier to entry for the campaign, the Foundation will pick out teams or individuals who are truly capable and willing to serve the BUMO community.


#### Requirements for Application

Organizations or individuals interested in participating in the Community Governance Program are free to participate in the election of validating nodes or ecological nodes. The following conditions must be met for the campaign:

**Requirement for Margin**

Each organization or individual applying for the Super Nodes Campaign needs to transfer at least 3,000,000 BUs to the address of margin as margin for the campaign (ie, the campaign entry threshold). The margin cannot be traded and cannot be used during the campaign and during the node running, unless the campaign node voluntarily gives up the qualifications for the super node campaign.

After the campaign node confirms the withdrawal of the campaign or gives up the node qualification, the frozen margin or additional margin cannot be retrieved immediately. By default, it enters a review period which lasts at most 30 days. After passing the review, the frozen margin will be returned to the original token account address in 5 working days. Meanwhile, the node qualification and node operation qualification will be cancelled.

**Other Requirements**

1. Each organization or individual applying for the Super Nodes Campaign needs to be in line with the values of BUMO and is interested in promoting the ecological development of BUMO and blockchain technology, so as to facilitate the development of the entire blockchain industry.

2. Each organization or individual applying for the Super Nodes Campaign is willing to provide pertinent advice for the overall ecological development of BUMO, and contributes to the development of the BUMO projects and provide resources.

3. In accordance with the principle of voluntary participation, organizations or individuals apply to become super nodes by transferring margin and providing authentic and valid qualification materials, and subject to the BUMO Foundation's review rules.

4. In order to speed up the development of the BUMO ecosystem, the Foundation will provide more resources for promotion and marketing to promote the construction of nodes:

   1. Partners and community volunteers who have contributed to BUMO in technology research and development, community building, and operation and development in the early stage.

   2. Including but not limited to organizations or individuals with certain resources in terms of technology, communities, tokens, projects, public influence, etc.

   3. Those who submit a complete support plan for the BUMO ecology at the time of application, including but not limited to operating plan, contribution commitment, budgetary expenses, etc.


#### How to Participate in the Validating Nodes Campaign

As physical nodes, the validating nodes participate in the BU Firework consensus and block packaging. The top 19 nodes in the validating nodes campaign set enjoy the validating rights and rewards and take turns to serve as the master node for block packaging. The nodes ranked 20 to 100 in the validating nodes campaign set enjoy the rewards for candidate nodes but without validating rights.

The applicant for validating node needs to provide the following authentic and valid qualification materials on the BUMO Community Governance Campaign registration page (the applicant downloads the qualification attachment on the prompt page of successful transfer after transferring in the campaign margin, and submits the completed electronic qualification form to Supernode@bumo.io). 

1. Basic information of the node: node name, node LOGO, campaign slogan, introduction to node to help users quickly know and select campaign nodes to vote.

2. Configuration information of the node: geographic location of node, server configuration, cloud service provider of node deployment. The campaign node needs to be configured in advance before applying, and the consensus and block packaging are started immediately after the foundation review is passed.

3. Basic information of the organizational/institutional applicant: organization/institution name, abbreviation, LOGO, overview introduction, key team member introduction, business overview, official website address and valid certificates. The more complete the information is filled, the more favorable the foundation is for review.

4. Basic information of the node operator: name, telephone, email, and WeChat to facilitate the platform operator to timely notify the node status update.

5. Token account address: the initiator of margin when applying for becoming a validating node, the blockchain address associated with Token-related operations (additional margin, reward, withdrawal of margin, etc.) belong to the token account address.

6. Validating node account address: the address configured on the server for the validating node. This address gets involved in blockchain consensus, transaction verification and block packaging.
It is suggested not to have the validating node address consistent with the Token account address. It is recommended to generate a new address on the server as the validating node address. Even if the server is stolen, it will not affect the security of the token account address.

7. Reward ratio for voting: the applicant for the validating node can customize the reward ratio for voters in the application process to encourage more users to vote for it. After the voting starts, the reward ratio can be adjusted too.

8. Node sponsoring plan: operating plan, contribution commitment, budgetary expenses, and submission of a complete BUMO sponsoring plan is helpful to the success of the node election.

9. Hardware requirements

As a commercial-grade public chain, BUMO supports cross-platform deployment and is stable on mainstream systems such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS which are built on general-purpose x86 architecture servers. Candidates need to provide information such as physical hardware address, hardware configuration, bandwidth, and operating system.

Operating system requirements are as the following table:

Operating System |	Version

#### How to Participate in the Ecological Nodes Campaign

As virtual nodes, the ecological nodes build the BUMO ecology with social or public influence. The top 21 nodes in the ecological campaign set enjoy the ecological nodes reward, and the nodes ranked 22-100 in the ecological nodes campaign set enjoy the reward for candidate ecological nodes. The ecological nodes can participate in the election after raising enough margin through co-funding. 

The applicant for ecological node or the initiator of node co-funding needs to provide the following authentic and valid qualification materials on the BUMO Community Governance Program registration page (the node applicant downloads the qualification attachment on the prompt page of success transfer after transferring in the campaign margin, and submits the completed electronic qualification form to Supernode@bumo.io).

1. Basic information of the node: node name, node LOGO, campaign slogan, and introduction to the node to help users quickly know and select campaign nodes to vote.

2. Basic information of the applicant: name, valid identification, LinkedIn link, Twitter link, phone, email, and WeChat; the more complete the information, the more favorable for the foundation to review and node election success, and it is also convenient for the operator to notify the update status of the node.

3. Token account address: the initiator of margin when applying to become an ecological node, the blockchain address associated with token-related operations (additional margin, reward, withdrawal of margin, etc.) belong to the token account address.

4. Reward ratio for voting: the applicant for the ecological node can customize the reward ratio for voting users in the application process to encourage more users to vote for it. After the voting starts, the reward ratio can be adjusted too.

5. Node sponsoring plan: operating plan, contribution commitment, budgetary expenses, and the submission of complete BUMO sponsoring plan is helpful to the success of the node election.


##### Node Co-funding

If the tokens held by the applicant for ecological node cannot individually meet the entry threshold of the Community Governance Program, the applicant can meet the entry threshold of the Community Governance Program by initiating node co-funding to obtain support from other personnel. The organization or individual that initiates the node co-funding project needs to transfer at least 1,000,000 BUs to the foundation's publicly announced address of margin as the node co-funding margin. In addition to the information required to be submitted by the regular node, the following information should be provided:

1. The node co-funding needs to clearly explain the purpose of launching the project, which is convenient for users to provide support.

2. In addition, the node co-funding initiator needs to make it clear: the entry purchase amount, the number of shares to support, and the target amount. The project initiator can split the target amount according to specific situation and the estimated number of supporters, and set the minimum purchase amount and shares for later rewards and rewards clearing. If the supporters participating in the co-funding and the total margin submitted by the co-funding initiator do not reach the minimum requirement, it will be considered as a co-funding failure.

## Node Operating

### Node Application and Release

After the Super Nodes Campaign related website goes online, the eligible organizations and individuals can apply for a super node.

#### Node Application and Information Release

After the application for a super node is approved, the campaign participants can query their own organization or personal information in the Community Governance Program page of the official website of BUMO.

The BUMO Foundation will release the campaign information of the contestants on the Community Governance Program page of the official website of BUMO. The BUMO Foundation will work together with media resources to timely release relevant news and reports on registration and voting and conduct exclusive interviews with institutions or individuals. 

#### Modification to Node Information

After the node campaign approval is passed, if you want to modify information, such as the node information, you can send relevant information to the node campaign mailbox of BUMO Foundation, and the BUMO Foundation staff will help to modify the relevant information of the node.

If you want to modify the reward ratio for voting and other information, you can send relevant information to the node campaign mailbox of BUMO Foundation, and the BUMO Foundation staff will help you to modify the node and generate a QR code for modification confirmation. The campaign participants can scan the QR code using BU Pocket to confirm the modification with their private key, and then the modification takes effect.

#### Withdrawal of Nodes during Information Release

When the organization or individual participating in the node campaign wants to withdraw from the node campaign, the institution or individual is required to send an email confirming the withdrawal to the email address of node campaign of BUMO Foundation using the email address provided during registration. After receiving the email, the BUMO Foundation will send an email containing the QR code of confirming the withdrawal from the node campaign to the campaign participants. The campaign participants will scan the QR code with BU Pocket using their private key to re-confirm to withdrawal from the node campaign. Thereafter, the node will enter a 30-day review period. After the review is passed, the node will exit the queue of the campaign nodes, and the margin of the campaign node will be returned to the corresponding account within 5 working days.

### Node Voting

#### When to Start Voting

The vote is expected to start on June 2, 2019. Based on the initial ranking, each node is ranked dynamically according to the equity value.

#### How to Calculate Equity Value

Equity value of the campaign node = the number of BUs in the margin * 2 + the number of votes obtained by the node.

#### Rewards for Voting

The BUMO Foundation does not set any awards for voters.
The campaign node can set the reward ratio for voting at the time of application for a node. The ratio is the reward pool set up by the node to encourage users to vote for it. Rewards to the voters participating in the campaign node will be proportionally distributed according their votes to the node and the total votes received by the node.


#### Withdrawal (Change) of Voting Rules

The user can withdraw the votes at any time, and the withdrawn votes will not be calculated in the voting reward for the day.

### Node Startup and Distribution of Rewards for Nodes

#### Node Startup

When the node voting starts, the nodes start to run.

When the node voting starts, the validating nodes start to run and in charge of block generation.

When the node voting starts, the node reward begins.

#### Rewards to Nodes

The top 19 nodes in the validating nodes campaign set enjoy the validating nodes reward. The nodes ranked 20~100 in the validating nodes campaign set enjoy the candidate validating nodes rewards. The top 19 validating nodes take turns to serve as the master node for block packaging. Nodes ranked 101 and later do not get rewards.

The top 21 nodes in the ecological nodes campaign set enjoy the ecological nodes reward, and the nodes ranked 22-100 in the ecological nodes campaign set enjoy the candidate ecological nodes reward. Nodes ranked 101 and later do not get rewards.

The initial ranking of the nodes is sorted according to the initial equity value, and the node ranking changes according to the equity value and changes at any time. The first node reward will be issued the next day.

The statistics for the first voting reward is also carried out the following day. Voting rewards will be issued the following day after voting award statistics is done.

### Node Application at Runtime

After the nodes start running, the eligible organizations and individuals can continue to apply for nodes. The node application and information release process are unchanged.

After the node application, information release, and review process is completed, start the node voting channel and participate node ranking. When the equity value increases and the node ranking is in line with the reward requirement, the reward is automatically received.

### Node Withdrawal

#### Withdrawal of Validating Nodes

When the organization or individual operating the validating node wants to withdraw, the institution or individual is required to send an email confirming the withdrawal to the email address of node campaign of BUMO Foundation using the email address provided during registration. After receiving the email, the BUMO Foundation will send an email containing the QR code of confirming to withdraw from the node campaign. The node operator will scan the QR code with BU Pocket using their private key to re-confirm to withdraw from the node campaign. Thereafter, the node will enter a 30-day review period. After the review is passed, the node will exit the node queue, and the margin of the campaign node will be returned to the corresponding account within 5 working days.


#### Withdrawal of Ecological Nodes

When the organization or individual operating the ecological node wants to withdraw, the institution or individual is required to send an email confirming the withdrawal to the email address of node campaign of BUMO Foundation using the email address provided during registration. After receiving the email, the BUMO Foundation will send an email containing the QR code of confirming to withdraw from the node campaign. The node operator will scan the QR code with BU Pocket using their private key to re-confirm to withdraw from the node campaign. Thereafter, the node will enter a 30-day review period. After the review is passed, the node will exit the node queue, and the margin of the campaign node will be returned to the corresponding account within 5 working days.

#### Forced Withdrawal by Validating Nodes

When the validating node fails to complete the information interaction on the main network due to unknown factors, the validating node will automatically stop receiving the validating reward. If the validating node cannot recover the service within 72 hours, the validating node will be forced to exit the super node list. The node automatically enters the withdrawal process, which is a 30-day review period for the validating node to withdraw.

## Rewards You can Get as a Super Node

### Reward Distribution Rules for Super Nodes

The block rewards and transaction fees for each block will be allocated to the super nodes and candidate nodes in a certain proportion. 

The current reward distribution ratio is shown in the following table:


Total reward = daily block reward (69,120 BUs per day) + transaction fee | |
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------
Reward distribution ratio| Validating nodes: Candidate validating nodes: Ecological nodes: Candidate ecological nodes = 50:10:35:5
Validating nodes | Reward received by validating nodes = (block reward + transaction fee) * 50%
Candidate validating nodes | Reward received by candidate validating nodes = (block reward + transaction fee) * 10%
Ecological nodes | Reward received by ecological nodes = (block reward + transaction fee) * 35%
Candidate ecological nodes| Reward received by candidate ecological nodes = (block reward + transaction fee) * 5%

### When to Release Rewards

Release Time of Node Reward: Reward clearing on each Natural Day, Singapore Time (GMT+08:00) and then the reward is issued to the token account address of the campaign node.

The reward to sponsors of node co-funding and the node reward are issued concurrently, which may be slightly delayed due to technical reasons. 

Reward for voting: in order to avoid the voting manipulation, it will be randomly distributed to the voters on the following day.


### How to Calculate Rewards to Validating Nodes

The transaction fees distributed will increase with time. The current daily transaction volume of Ethereum is about 500,000. Assuming a daily transaction volume of 500,000 on the BUMO chain, calculate according to the transaction fee of 0.0025BU per transaction, then the total transaction fee is: 500000 * 0.0025 = 1250 BUs

The total reward that can be obtained by the validating nodes per day is: (69120+1250)*50% = 35,185 BUs

The total reward that can be obtained by the candidate validating nodes per day is: (69120+1250)*10% = 7,037 BUs

### How to Calculate Rewards to Ecological Nodes

The transaction fee distributed will increase with time. The current daily transaction volume of Ethereum is about 500,000. Assuming a daily transaction volume of 500,000 on the BUMO chain, calculate according to the transaction fee of 0.0025BU per transaction, then the total transaction fee is: 500000 * 0.0025 = 1250 BUs

The total reward that can be obtained by the ecological nodes per day is: (69120+1250)*35% = 24629.5 BUs

The total reward that can be obtained by the candidate ecological nodes per day is: (69120+1250)*5% = 3518.5 BUs

#### How to Calculate Rewards to Co-funding Nodes

n：The remaining rewards of an ecological node after deducting its voting award

nn：The reward for the co-founder of a node in the ecological nodes

ll：The margin provided by sponsors for this node co-funding project

r：The total amount of margin received by the co-funding node (including the initiator and sponsors)

The formula for rewards to the sponsors of this co-funding node: nn= n * ll/r

### Campaign Nodes can Reward Voters

The platform does not set any incentives for voters, but the campaign nodes can provide incentives for voters. The campaign nodes can customize the reward ratio for voters when applying for a node.

a%: A campaign node customizes the proportion of rewards for voters, and only for voters

m：The campaign node receives rewards from the total reward pool

n：The rewards that the campaign node can retain in rewards for voting

x：The total number of votes won by this campaign node

l：The number of votes a user has voted for the campaign node

p：The rewards received by the above voters in rewards for voting

The formula about how much rewards the campaign node can retain in the rewards for voting process: n= m * (1-a%)

The formula about how much rewards a user can receive in the rewards for voting process for this node: p=m * a% * l/x

## Other Instructions

### Protection to Node Information

For any material submitted by applicants participating in the BUMO Community Governance Program, the BUMO Foundation will only use it to confirm the applications’ qualifications and rewards. These materials will not be exposed to the third party or used for other purposes, except the required information that needs to be announced during the campaign or disclosed according to law.

### Modification to Node Operation Rules

The BUMO Community Governance Program is initiated by the BUMO Foundation. The node campaign and operating rules are developed by the BUMO Foundation, and the BUMO Foundation has the right to interpret the rules accordingly.

After the Community Governance Program is completed, the top 3 validating nodes and the top 2 ecological nodes will form the Node Committee. The BUMO Node Committee replaces the BUMO Foundation as the highest authority for the BUMO Public Chain Ecosystem. All decisions must be approved by at least 3/5 nodes of the committee.

### Legal Jurisdiction

Disputes arising from the operation of the BUMO Community Governance Program are governed by the laws of Singapore and are determined by the Singapore Arbitration Body.
